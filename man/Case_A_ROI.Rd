\title{Sarcoma tumor region of interest in the upper thigh. 
This scan was acquired at University of Washington in Seattle, USA.
Uptake values are expressed in SUV scale for this test dataset
(Clinical SUVmax = 2.7). The ellipsoidal ROI was hand-drawn by expert 
at the UW School of Medicine. 
This is frame 0, gate 0, i.e. one static FDG-PET scan.}
\format{An array with 5 columns as follows:
\describe{
   \item{Value}{Uptake value}
   \item{Weight}{Voxel weight (dummy values set to 1)}
   \item{X (mm)}{x-coordinate in the scanner referential}
   \item{Y (mm)}{y-coordinate in the scanner referential}
   \item{Z (mm)}{z-coordinate in the scanner referential}
